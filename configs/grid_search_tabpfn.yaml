# Grid search configuration for from-scratch TabPFN fire detection training.
#
# Usage:
#   python train_tabpfn.py --config configs/grid_search_tabpfn.yaml
#
# TabPFN is initialized with random weights (model_path="random:<seed>")
# and trained with gradient descent. No pretrained download needed.
#
# Grid size: 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 48 total runs.
