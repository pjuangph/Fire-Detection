# Grid search configuration for TabPFN classification fire detection training.
#
# Usage:
#   python train_tabpfn_classification.py --config configs/grid_search_tabpfn_classification.yaml
#
# TabPFN is initialized with random weights (model_path="random:<seed>")
# and trained with gradient descent using cross-entropy loss.
#
# Grid size: 2 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16 total runs.
